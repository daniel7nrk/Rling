# 🔔 Automatic Bell System using Arduino Uno

## Description
This project uses an Arduino Uno to automatically ring a bell based on a real-time schedule. Ideal for schools, offices, or any environment with time-based routines.

## 🧰 Components
- Arduino Uno
- DS3231 RTC Module
- Relay Module
- Electric Bell or Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- (Optional) LCD Display

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The RTC keeps track of the time.
- The Arduino compares the current time to preset bell times.
- At the right time, it triggers the relay, ringing the bell for a set duration.

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Working with real-time clocks
- Controlling relays
- Timing logic in Arduino
- Interfacing hardware safely

## 💾 Code
See `sketch` for the full code.
